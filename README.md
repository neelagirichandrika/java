This project is a simple Java-based stock forecasting system developed using a command-line interface. The user enters the number of stocks, stock names, and their prices for the last three months.
The program calculates the average stock price, predicts a future value using a basic formula, and then compares the forecast with the last month’s price to determine whether the stock results in a profit, loss, or no change.
The project uses CSV files to store both input and output data, and makes use of core Java concepts like file handling, ArrayList, HashMap, and object-oriented programming. 
It is designed as a beginner-friendly mini project to understand data processing and forecasting logic in Java.
